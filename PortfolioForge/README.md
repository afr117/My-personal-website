## Running Locally

If you've downloaded this project and want to run it on your computer:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   The `.env` file already contains your password (`password123333`) and is ready to use!
   
   **Important:** The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` so it won't be shared publicly.

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open Your Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

The landing animation plays automatically, then you'll see your full portfolio after 5 seconds.

**Admin Access:** Visit `http://localhost:5000/admin/login` and use your password (`password123333`) to access the admin panel.

## Deploying to PythonAnywhere with GoDaddy Domain

Your portfolio is fully compatible with PythonAnywhere hosting. Here's how to deploy:

### Quick Start Commands

Once you've uploaded your files to PythonAnywhere, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Start the application
npm start
```

That's it! Your portfolio will be running. Continue below for detailed setup instructions.

### Step 1: Upload Your Files to PythonAnywhere

1. **Create a PythonAnywhere Account**
   - Go to [www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
   - Sign up for a Web Developer account

2. **Upload Your Project**
   - Open a Bash console in PythonAnywhere
   - Upload your project files via the Files tab or use git:
   ```bash
   git clone your-repository-url
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

3. **Install Node.js and Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create the `.env` file on PythonAnywhere**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Your `.env` is already configured** with:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=password123333`
   - `SESSION_SECRET=` (already has a secure random key)
   - `NODE_ENV=production` (change this to production when deploying)
   - `PORT=5000` (or whatever PythonAnywhere assigns)

3. **Edit .env for production**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
   Change `NODE_ENV=development` to `NODE_ENV=production`

### Step 3: Set Up the Web App

1. **Configure PythonAnywhere Web App**
   - Go to the "Web" tab
   - Click "Add a new web app"
   - Choose "Manual configuration" and select Node.js
   - Set the working directory to your project folder

2. **Configure the WSGI/Start Command**
   PythonAnywhere needs to run your Node.js app. Set the command to:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Update package.json** (if needed)
   Make sure your `package.json` has a start script:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "NODE_ENV=production node --loader tsx server/index.ts",
     "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

1. **In GoDaddy:**
   - Go to your domain's DNS management
   - Add a CNAME record:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Name: `@` (or `www`)
     - Value: `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
     - TTL: 1 hour

2. **In PythonAnywhere:**
   - Go to the "Web" tab
   - Add your GoDaddy domain in the "Add a new web app" section
   - Follow the verification steps

3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take 1-48 hours)

### Step 5: Start Your Application

```bash
npm start
```

Your portfolio will be live at your GoDaddy domain! üéâ

### Troubleshooting PythonAnywhere

- **Port Issues:** PythonAnywhere may require a specific port. Check their docs for the correct port.
- **Build Errors:** Run `npm run build` if needed for production
- **.env Not Loading:** Make sure `dotenv` is installed and `.env` exists in the root folder
- **Admin Login:** Use `password123333` at `/admin/login`

### Important Notes

‚úÖ Your `.env` file is **compatible** with PythonAnywhere  
‚úÖ Your password is already set in `.env.example`  
‚úÖ Just copy `.env.example` to `.env` and you're ready to deploy!
