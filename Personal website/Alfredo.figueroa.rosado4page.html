		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p class="edit3"> My name is Alfredo Figueroa Rosado a young entrepreneur on the path of self-development. I was born on a small island, Puerto Rico one of the most beautiful places on earth, with low education and not many jobs. From a young age, I started working mowing lawns, selling fruits, or helping build. Went thru basic training in a military program (phoenix military) run by a retired Army captain. I left school to go train at the PR youth challenge academy of the National Guard where I learn discipline and military tactics where I finish 3 Years of High school knowledge in 6 months while getting military training as like a basic soldier. Once I graduated I left PR to start working and expand my knowledge in the tech industries and become a mechatronic engineer. </p>
