		<h2>Chosen Path</h2>
		<p class="edit1">When I was a child I had many challenges and education isn't the best from where I came from but one thing was certain when all else was just an idea and that is I LOVE to build/take things apart and see how they work and why. When I got older I realize no matter what, I'm a builder and in that path of self-discovery I found web development. Seeing the high versatility and the greatness of web development to create I knew, that is a skill I want & needed so I went online and found different courses sadly only pieces of the required skill of full stack development to be able to work professionally. So currently I work to gain those skills to be of use to develop my career in tech and skyrocket my knowledge of creating.  </p>
